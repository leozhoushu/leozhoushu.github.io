  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="introduction">This pavilion serves as a Moutain Club. The whole design emphasizes on creating a series of feelings for people by controlling their line of sight using walls and columns. Tourists will enjoy a much more open scenery after the initial sight obstruction.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle2 alignleft ">Inspiration from Ancient Chinese Paintings</h2>
        <p>I used the mountain to create a similar image of Chinese ancient paintings. From every angle, people cannot see the whole pavilion but a little part of it, which will direct their sight as well as attract their interests. </p>

        <p>The plan and roof of this pavilion are carefully designed to create strong contrasts between different perspectives. I hope to increase people's awareness of surronding natural environment by manipulaing their views.</p>
