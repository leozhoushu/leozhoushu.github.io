  <!--=============== Problems ====================-->
  <div class="paragraph">
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Problemsâ€”Participants need to be empowered</h2>
    <p>Our client Tom is currently writing the book <i>Ceremony</i> which he hopes will improve productivity in the workplace. He will be consulting companies on his book and wanted to also build a companion app to help companies implement the book's teachings. <strong>In his vision, it should be a pretty simple app: asking people three related questions after each meeting, quick and easy. </strong>However what we concerned more is how to empower people to use this app. Rating a ceremony can be one extra work, we need to dig out and stimulate user's inside motivation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ceremony</strong><br>Ceremony is any repeated social interaction between two or more people, like meeting, wedding, friend gathering etc. In our case, we mainly focused on meetings.</li>
      
    </ul>
    
  </div>

  <!--=============== Findings ====================-->
  <div class="paragraph below-occupy">
    <h2 class="subtitle2">So, what makes a good meeting?</h2>
    <p>To better understand uers, we first did our own user research. We interviewed 8 different people and asked them questions about the meetings they attend. We talked to people who work in a wide range of industries including academic, religious, financial, construction, co-op housing, consulting, and technology.</p>
    <div class="col-1-2 c-col">
    	<p>We created an affinity wall based on the interviews. Here's attributes we foungd apply to a productive meeting.</p>
    	<ul class="affinity-list">
    		<li>Participant engagement in the meeting is key</li>
    		<li>People should feel encouraged to contribute</li>
    		<li>Good leadership matters</li>
    		<li>Good meeting structure increases productivity</li>
    		<li>Positive group culture helps meetings evolve</li>

    <h2 class="subtitle2">User Journey</h2>
    <p>We first did our own user research. We interviewed 8 different people and asked them questions about the meetings they attend. We talked to people who work in a wide range of industries including academic, religious, financial, construction, co-op housing, consulting, and technology. From our interviews, we created <strong>personas</strong> of a meeting's <strong>participant</strong> and <strong>host</strong> to better understand how each ceremony goes and what people's emotional status is.<br>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>How to make rating quick while informative?</strong></p>
      <p>Out client Tom asked us to incorporate three questions he had concluded into the rating phase. We discussed a lot about it. Should we let people choose from positive neutral negative, or should we provide a rating bar from 0 to 5? After testing, we found people can't tell the difference between a 3 point meeting and a 2 point meeting. Also in most cases they tended to be nertral. However, point or neutral are meaningless, the app is supposed to find problems of meetings. So we decided to make it extremely easy with only two options, <strong>we did it on purpose to push users to select an opinion</strong>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>How to make dashboard straightforward?</strong></p>
      <p>Too much information can be distracting, so we kept simplifying our design to make it easily understandable. In the end, we used different size for smiley and frown face to indicate each ceremony's result.</p>

    <div class="col-1-2-new width66">
      <div class="padding-50-noleft">
        <h2 class="subtitle2 alignleft ">Final Solution</h2>
        <p>The whole process consists of four parts:<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul class="steps">
          <li>1) Set up a ceremony</li>
          <li>2) Receive notification</li>
          <li>3) Provide anonymous feedback</li>
          <li>4) Analyze data</li>

 <!--=============== Set Up ====================-->
  <div class="padding-100 table">

    <div class="col-1-2-new width66">
      <div class="padding-50-noleft">
        <img class="width100" src="../picture/ceremony/setup.png" alt="setup">

      <div class="">
        <h2 class="subtitle2 alignleft ">1) Set up a ceremony</h2>
        <p>We decided to make this process more seamless by including all of the fields on one screen and <strong>having a progress indicator</strong> at the top. </p>  
      </div>
    </div>

 <!--=============== 2+3) ====================-->
  <div class="padding-100 table background-grey">

    <div class="col-1-2-new width66">
      <div class="padding-50-noleft">
        <h2 class="subtitle2 alignleft ">2) Receive notifications &amp; 3) Provide feedback</h2>
        <p>From our user tests we learned this was the most important part of the user flow. We had to <strong>make this as quick and as easy as possible</strong> or else users would not respond to the survey prompt. So we simplified the three questions our client outlined into one overarching "How did the ceremony go?". <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>A user just needs to tap a smiley button and they are done.</strong> However, to allow for more qualitative responses we added attribute buttons that are optional along with an optional comments field. The attributes can be customized. We used our affinity wall findings to create the stock buttons content.</p>

      <div class="padding-50-noleft">
        <h2 class="subtitle2 alignleft ">4) Analyze data - Overview</h2>
        <p>Finally, we visualized the data from the survey responses in a dashboard. A user is provided an overview of all of the ceremonies they attend. Users can also <strong>filter the data to look for patterns and trends</strong>. They can say "I want to see all of the attributes for ceremonies that are trending up."</p>

        <p>Users can also drill into the <strong>trend lines of individual ceremonies</strong>. The app puts data into the hands of employees. The data speaks for itself: Ceremony makes it transparent. Bad data empowers positive change.  Good data allows employees to see what is working well.</p>

 <!--=============== Challenges ====================-->
  <div class="paragraph below-occupy">
    <h2 class="subtitle2">Challenges</h2>
    <p><strong>Client's vision</strong> &nbsp;x&nbsp; <strong>Our thinking</strong><br>The first time we met our client, he already had a rough wireframe of this app and gave us some sketches. So what we did was trying to add motivation into this app to make sure potential users indeed want to use it. To achieve this, we challenged to change the original three questions which were part of core ideas in client's vision into one overarching question. The communication actually went smoothly in terms of we provided user's feedback and convincing design results each time.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>A team full of designers</strong> &nbsp;x&nbsp; <strong>One final design decision</strong><br>Since our team was full of designers, we would all design features separately and then get together as a group for a design critique of everyone's designs. As a group we'd pull out what we liked from each, iterate, and design the next requirement together in the same way.</p>
